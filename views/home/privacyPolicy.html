            <p>
                In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid
                legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with
                laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your

                If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.<br>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we

                to process your personal information:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your

                <li> Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance
                    with
                    our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
                    exercise
                    or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                    involved.</li>
                <li>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your
                    vital
                    interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to
                    the
                    safety of any person.</li>
            </ul>
            If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.<br>
            We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use
            your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred
            (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.<br>
            In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
            without your consent, including, for example:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
                    timely
                    way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or
                    settle
                    an insurance claim</li>
                <li> For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial
                    abuse
                </li>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or
                    the
                    accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
                    breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>
                    If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court
                    relating to the production of records
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and
                    the
                    collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

                    If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl">WHEN DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p>
                We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
                    negotiations
                    of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
                    business to
                    another company.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p>
                In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.<br>
                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
                this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your
                personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.<br>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
                and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p>
                In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
                security measures.<br>
                We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed
                to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
                efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
                technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
                improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
                your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
                risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

                In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection
                laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,

                Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which
                may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw
                your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the

                However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal,
                nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br>
                Account Information<br>
                If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
                account, you can:<br>
                Log in to your account settings and update your user account.<br>
                Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information
                from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with
                applicable legal requirements.

            <h2 class="text-2xl">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard
                for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
                DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
                you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

            information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain
            exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her
            right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing
            that may be required to protect against illegal activities.<br><br>
            Right to be informed — Request to know<br>
            Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

            In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that

            consumer request.<br><br>
            Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer's Privacy Rights<br>
            We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.<br><br>
            Verification process<br>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
            about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For
            instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
            contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to
            us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.<br>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to
            make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for
            the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
            maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
            your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
            information as soon as we finish verifying you.<br><br>
            Other privacy rights<br>
            You may object to the processing of your personal information.<br>
            You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to
            restrict the processing of the information.<br>
            You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a
            request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to
            act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.<br>
            You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon
            receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later
            than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.<br>
            To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at <a
